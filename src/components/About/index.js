                <p>
                    I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto and completed my Bachelors of Science in Human Biology and Neuroscience. 
                    I am now a research assistant for a professor at the University of Toronto Scarborough campus and I am studying infant development,
                    specifically rhythm perception across infancy and childhood. 
                    
                    Over the last few months I began a coding bootcamp at the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies and I am working towards 
                    becoming a full stack web developer.
